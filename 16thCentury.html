            <!--Giulia dei Medici-->
    <p>
        <img src="./assets/images/16th Century Europe/GiuliadeiMedici.jpg"/>
        This is a portrait of Giulia dei (or de) Medici. She is a woman of Italian-Moorish descent. 
        I think Italy's history of black people hasn't always been told very much. Especially the relation between the Moors in Latin America 
        in the 1500s. I decent from many groups of people Nigeria, South Africa, Ireland, Wales, Italy, England, Portugal and other places. 
        In the 1940s they originally thought this was a portrait of Maria de Medici, but later found out it was a portrait of Gulia dei Medici 
        and her son, Gulio de Medici, circa 1540. She is wearing several layers of clothing, given that was a sign of showing the status of one's 
        wealth. The Medici's were very wealthy. She is wearing a head scarf to show a contrast to Mary the Virgin after giving birth to her son. 
        The fabric is black, because of her widow hood, and would more than likely been a wool, because of the Florence region of Italy was and is 
        still know for their wool selling productions. The family also had investments in the wool industry. She also isn't wearing an jewelry 
        because of mourning. The sleeves are puffed. Her smock is seen under neath the top layer of her costume. The portrait is similar to 
        several "Madonna" portraits of the 1500s. (Langton)

        <!--Costanza Da Sommaia-->
        <img src="./assets/images/16th Century Europe/COSTANZADASOMMAIA.jpg"/>
        This is a portrait of Costanza Da Sommaia By Bronzino before her marriage. Her hair is uncovered and tied up. 
        Women did not wear their hair down in the 1500s in public. She wears expensive gold jewelry, as in the description in the academic 
        journal. (It wasn't in color because the image was copied and printed into a textbook in the 1930s.) Her pleated smock is showing 
        underneath her gown and placard. (Richardson)

        <!--Image of Unknown Woman-->
        <img src="./assets/images/16th Century Europe/PortaitofUnknownWoman.jpg"/>
        This is a portrait of an enslaved African woman in Italy, her name is still unknown. 
        Due to the household she is forced to working in, she is wearing handed down fine clothing, including wool layers and other fibers. 
        She is wearing a decorated beaded necklace and pearl golden earrings. A thin layer of her smock is shown. Her placard is dyed black 
        and is embroidered with black work threads. She is also holding such a beautiful gorgeous clock in hand! (Carracci)

        <!--Margaret of Parma-->
        <img src="./assets/images/16th Century Europe/MargaretofParma.jpg"/>
        The image here is a portrait of Margaret of Parma painted in 1562. She is wearing love a lovely set of double stranded pearls that 
        reach to the waist line. Her gown is embroidered with gold. Her sleeves are fitted to her wrists. Underneath the sleeves her smock is 
        shown. She has a short ruff around her neck. Side note: In my opinion, for a Netherlandic Governor she is wearing a very Latin-European
            gown. I she wanted to keep her Italian heritage while she was abroad. Her hair is covered in a sheer cap. It would have been 
            acceptable for the late 1500s not to wear a head covering, but because of her age and stature probably decided to cover it for 
            political and social reasons because she represented her people. (Mor)

            <!--Eastern Woodland Tribe-->
            <img src="./assets/images/16th Century Europe/EasternWoodlandTribe.jpg"/>
            Here is a portrait of an Eastern Woodland Tribe Contact Period. The front is the men's lower bodies are covered in a hyde fabric cloth.
            The women have long braided hair and have cuff bracelets. The men's hair beautifully has feathers attached to the center of their head. 
            The front of the hair is shaven. The European men are wearing traditional clothing of the early 1600s period. (Unknown Author, 2007)
